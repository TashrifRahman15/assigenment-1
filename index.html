                    <p>You are great at what you do. You have a clear roadmap of where you want your career to take you.
                        However, even when you have every step, milestone, and promotion mapped out, the reality is that
                        advancing doesnot happen overnight, and its common for work energy levels to drop — particularly
                        at the end of the year. Suddenly things that you took in your stride can feel like a slog and
                        you can get bogged down and demotivated. For example, a professional development course you were
                        excited about a month ago starts to feel like a drain on your energy, or a work project you felt
                        confident about suddenly appears to be overwhelming.</p> <br>
